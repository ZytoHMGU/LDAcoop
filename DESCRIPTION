Description: Cellular cooperation compromises the established method of 
    calculating clonogenic actitivy from LDA data. This tool provides functions 
    that enable robust analysis in presence or absence of cellular cooperation.
        The implemented method incorporated the same cooperativity module to 
    model the non-linearity associated with cellular cooperation as known from 
    the colony formation assay. (see Brix et al. (2021): "Analysis of clonogenic 
    growth in vitro." Nature protocols, 2021, 16, 4963-4991)
