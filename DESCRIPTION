Description: Cellular cooperation compromises the established method of 
    calculating clonogenic activity from LDA data. This tool provides functions 
    that enable robust analysis in presence or absence of cellular cooperation. 
    The implemented method incorporated the same cooperativity module to model 
    the non-linearity associated with cellular cooperation as known from the 
    colony formation assay (Brix et al. (2021) <doi:10.1038/s41596-021-00615-0>: 
    "Analysis of clonogenic growth in vitro." Nature protocols).
